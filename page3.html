        <p>Random number game and how it works:
            <br><br><br>

            1. **Designed a Number Game**: We created a number game that challenges players to match a randomly generated number with one of several clickable number buttons.
            <br><br><br>
            2. **Game Overview**: The game displays a set of number buttons (from 1 to 10) and generates a random target number each time the player clicks the "Generate Random Number" button.
            <br><br><br>
            3. **Random Number Generation**: When the game starts or the button is clicked, a random number between 1 and 10 is generated and displayed at the top of the page.
            <br><br><br>
            4. **Button Interaction**: The player can click on any of the number buttons to guess the target number. Each button corresponds to a number from 1 to 10.
            <br><br><br>
            5. **Correct Guess**: If the player clicks the button that matches the randomly generated number, a "Winner! You got the number!" message is shown, and the game continues with a new random number.
            <br><br><br>
            6. **Incorrect Guess**: If the player selects the wrong number, a "Wrong number, try again!" message appears, and the number of remaining chances is decremented by one.
            <br><br><br>
            7. **Chances Display**: The game keeps track of the number of chances the player has left. This is displayed prominently on the page and decreases with each incorrect guess.
            <br><br><br>
            8. **Game Over**: If the player exhausts all their chances without guessing the correct number, a "Game Over!" message is displayed.
            <br><br><br>
            9. **Visual Design**: The game is styled with a clean, user-friendly design, including a background image, neatly arranged buttons, and clear text to guide the player.
            <br><br><br>
            10. **Engaging Experience**: Overall, the number game provides an engaging and interactive experience, encouraging players to try and guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts.</p>
